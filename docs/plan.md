Step-by-Step Plan
1. Define the Grammar: Define the grammar of the language you want to parse. This could be a subset of JavaScript, a custom scripting language, or any other language.
  * for loop:
    ```
    for()
    ```
2. Lexical Analysis: Write a lexer to tokenize the input script. Tokens are the basic building blocks like keywords, identifiers, operators, etc.
3. Syntax Analysis: Write a parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokens. The AST represents the hierarchical structure of the source code.
4. Graph Representation: Convert the AST into a graph representation. Nodes in the graph can represent constructs like statements, expressions, and variables, while edges represent relationships between these constructs.
5. Execution Engine: Implement an execution engine that traverses the graph and executes the script.
